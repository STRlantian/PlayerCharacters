# Intro
This is my first individual Minecraft plugin.
It makes players in Minecraft have their own characters
And get some buff and debuff from them.
This idea was came up with by myself.

# Warning
1. It's better to use this plugin on paper or paper-based servers
2. Spigot is also OK but not recommanded bcs I haven't tested n Spigot and compiled the plugin use Paper's maven
3. You will not be able to change characters after changing them for 1 time
4. Please enable the plugin before any player joins the server
5. Please do not edit the config.yml file except you know what are you doing

That's all,
there is nothing more to say.
Have fun.
